#Introduction

## Motivations

*This section addresses the question: Why are you starting this project?*


As an example:
  
The project [BCN3D Moveo](https://github.com/BCN3D/BCN3D-Moveo/) is motivated by the high cost 
of the materials that undergraduate students must use for learning how to engineer mechatronics systems.

## Goals

*This section addresses the question: What will be delivered in this project?* 

As an example: 
  
The project [BCN3D Moveo](https://github.com/BCN3D/BCN3D-Moveo/) is an open source robotic arm 
that everyone should be able to replicate - with or without modification - at home without the need for highly 
technical knowledge and expensive materials. 
The robotic arm will support several of the existing training itineraries: 
mechanical design, automation, industrial programming, etc.


## History

*Here it is welcome to acknowledge the existing sources that have been used in this project with locations*

## Documentation structure

*How is your documentation organized?*


These guidelines will provide you with a standard structure that is mainly following the product 
life cycle and the technological decomposition. It is implemented in the documentation template available in this project. 
  
For example:
- Introduction
- Specification
- Design 
- Manufacturing
- Assembly
- Use
- Maintenance
- Disposal

And inside each of the sections, if required:
- Mechanical
- Electronic 
- Software 



## Required skills

*What is the specific knowledge a maker shall own to reuse - with or without modification - your product??*

For example:
  
The project echopen need basic knowledge about the medical ultrasound technology such as ultrasound imaging, 
a matter of acoustical impedance, etc.  


## Contribution Process

*Describe here how a maker can contribute to your project*

-  Example of a contribution process:
  - Post an [issue] and briefly outline the changes you plan to make
  - If you are looking for input on what to contribute, browse the issues with the Requests or Bug label
  - Describe branches
  - Describe what a Pull Request (PR) shall contain (detailed description of changes, a summary of the test, 
    issue numbers that the PR resolves)
  - Specify code style 
  - Contributor license agreement


## Last updates 

*What is the last update of your documentation?*
