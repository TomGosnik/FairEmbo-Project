# Introduction

## Motivations

The motivation for the project is to make access to embolisation possible in the most disadvantaged countries.
With the use of suture particles replacing the technology used today, this is now possible.

However, the cutting process must be precise, in large quantities and with an ajustable particles' length. Because it must meet the needs of different patients.
Manual scissor cutting is therefore not sufficient, so it is necessary to automate the process. 

## Goals

The aim of the project is to produce a machine that meets these requirements. 

This machine must be usable and adapted for regular use in a hospital. 
The interface must therefore be accessible for all staffs with simple but detailed instructions.
In addition, the cut thread can be found from a standard suture spool.

## History

The project originated from a group of health professionals, chaired by Professor Vincent Vidal.
Mr. Mathieu DE BIGLIESCE is the doctor who contacted us so that we could launch the project
