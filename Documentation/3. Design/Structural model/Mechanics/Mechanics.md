## **How to document a structural model of mechanical products?** 

 ### **1. Architectural structure**

- **Definition:** *The architectural structure is a physical or logical layout of the components of a system design and their internal and external connections.*

### Template of architectural structure
 
 - **Explanation:** The Template contains 2 main flow streams : 1. Power supply(represented in red), 2. Suture Wire (represented in green)

### **2.Editable CAD files**
 *Fairembo was designed in Freecad (version 0.19), allowing you to have full access to view, copy, edit, and export all of the source 3D CAD models for free from any computer which has installed Freecad* 

### Template of file format

  1. 3D/2D file format
     * '.FCStd' is the original Freecad file format, allowing you to change the dimensions of the component as you want
     * '.STEP' is a neutral format which is for representative use such as Stepper Motor, Arduino card.
     * '.Dxf' is a 2D file format which allow you to use it in laser cutting
     * '.Stl' is a 3D file format which mostly used in 3D printing
  2. Name of CAD software
     * FreeCAD
     * Version used : 0.19

### **3. Characteristics of the materials**
