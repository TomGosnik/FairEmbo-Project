## **How to document a structural model of mechanical products?** 

 ### **1. Architectural structure**

- **Definition:** *The architectural structure is a physical or logical layout of the components of a system design and their internal and external connections.*

### Template of architectural structure
 
 - **Explanation:** The Template contains 2 main flow streams : 1. Power supply(represented in red), 2. Suture Wire (represented in green)

### **2.Editable CAD files**
 *Fairembo was designed in Freecad (version 0.19) and contained 2 type of formats : '.FCStd' and '.STEP', allowing you to have full access to view, copy, edit, and export all of the source 3D CAD models for free from any computer which has installed Freecad* 
 
 ```
To reuse a design model, it should provide information consist of:

 1. Preferable 3D/2D file format
   - Editable file formats that could be:
     - Native formats such as .FCStd format of FreeCAD 
     - Neutral formats such as STEP files
 2. Preferable open-source software 
   - OpensCAD
   - Inkscape
   - FreeCAD
  ```

#### *Example of editable file formats:* 

*1. [Farmbot, Native CAD files](https://genesis.farm.bot/v1.5/Extras/cad)*

*2. [MIT Emergency Ventilator, Neutral CAD files](https://e-vent.mit.edu/resources/downloads/)*

*3. Types of CAD format of [transmagic](https://transmagic.com/cad-formats/)*

 #### Documentation a design in an editable file format
  1. 3D/2D file format
     * Native formats
     * Neutral formats
  2. Name of software
     * FreeCAD
     * ...

 
### **3. Characteristics of the materials**
