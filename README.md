FairEmbo - Fragmentation of surgical suture thread 


This project is part of a search for a new solution to the problem of embolisation in association with the FairEmbo company. 
Embolisation is a technology whose objective is to stop bleeding or blood circulation in a targeted area. The process closes a vessel by injecting a product into an artery under local anaesthetic. 

The embolisation procedure is not often used or considered in undeveloped countries because embolisation equipment is simply not affordable in some countries. For one operation, several hundred euros are required, which is simply not possible in some cases. So there is an unaffordable demand for third world countries. In addition, the embolisation product is not well distributed in these countries, so additional costs would have to be incurred for importing the goods needed to carry out the procedure.
It is then necessary to find a solution to develop and provide embolisation procedures for underdeveloped countries. This solution must be affordable and easy to implement in these countries. 

In the search for an affordable solution to enable underdeveloped countries to access embolisation procedures, the Radiology and Medical Imaging Department of the Marseille Hospital (France) is proposing a new solution using suture particles injected in large quantities into the arteries to close the vessels. 
In the case of the product used today, the embolisation is done chemically and gives the ability to accelerate thrombosis in the vessel.
In the case of sutures, it is the mechanical effect of the accumulation of pieces of suture that allows the embolisation of the vessel. 

Our customer, contacted us to think about the creation of a machine to cut the suture before the medical intervention. The suture is given in spools and the prototype must provide the cut particles and answer different functions presented in the specifications of the machine.

The main objective of this project is to design and manufacture a device capable of taking input in the form of suture spools, and providing output in the form of cut sutures suitable for the FairEmbo process. The design should be simple, easy to use and, above all, cost-effective. In this way, the project will contribute to the automation of the Fairembo technique without losing sight of the main objective of affordability for poor underdeveloped countries.
